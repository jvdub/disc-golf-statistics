# Disc Golf Statistics

This project is a stand-alone website to calculate some interesting statistics for a round of Disc Golf.

As it is right now, it's just a pet project as an excuse to learn some of the new features of ES6, Node, and Express that I haven't had the the opportunity to work with yet.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Browse to `localhost:3000`

## Contribution Guidelines

Probably best to hold off on any contributions at this point... If that wasn't obvious.
